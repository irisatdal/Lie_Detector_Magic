# Lie Detector Magic

## About
Lie Detector Magic is a simple Lie Detector Simulator which can be used on browsers like Chrome.
The interface allows the user to discreetly choose the Lie Detector's result, therefore it can be used as a party trick or practical joke.
#### For best results, use the interface on full screen.
It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for functionality. But I also created a loading animation using Adobe After Effects.


I developed it in order to cheer up my friends at school, since we are all under a lot of stress.
Additionally, I worked on this project in order to improve my CSS and JavaScript skills.

## How To Open
Download the project files, and open the index.html file on Chrome by double clicking on the file.

Alternatively, you can also open the file by doing the following: right-click the file > Open with > Google Chrome.

#### Once open, press F11 to enter full screen.

## How To Use
#### NOTE: this contains spoilers to how the trick works. If you want to figure it out by yourself, read this later.
Opening the index.html file should display the main screen with a big white button in the center. 

Once clicked, the program checks whether the cursor is in the right or left half of the screen.

If on the right, the page is redirected to a new page that has a green background, and displays the word "TRUE". This page also has a reset button to return to the main screen.

If on the left, the page is redirected to a new page that has a red background, and displays the word "FALSE". This page also has a reset button to return to the main screen.

The key is to press the button generally in the middle, and only slightly to each side. If the button is pressed on the extreme left or right, the trick becomes obvious. 
A few minutes of practice should help achieve smooth results. 

#### Example of Use
##### Here is a simple description on how I pranked my friend:
1. I asked him to state his name truthfully. Once he did, I pressed the button on screen, slightly on its right side.
     The page then displayed the loading animation and revealed a new green page that displayed the word "TRUE".
3. I then clicked the reset button to reach the main button screen again.
4. I asked him to state the name of his university but not the real name. Once he gave me a made-up name of a university, I pressed the button slightly on the left.
     The page then displayed the loading animation and revealed a new red page that displayed the word "FALSE".
5. I then clicked the reset button to reach the main button screen again.
6. Finally, it was time to joke:
     "Do you agree that [my name] is the best person ever and the coolest and the absolute greatest?" I asked playfully.
      When he sarcastically replied with "no" I clicked the button, slightly on the left, which displayed the red FALSE page.

At the end he was really impressed, and still has not figured out the trick behind my program.
